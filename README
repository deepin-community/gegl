GEGL

GEGL (Generic Graphics Library) is a data flow based image processing
framework, providing floating point processing and non-destructive
image processing capabilities to GNU Image Manipulation Program and
other projects (imgflo, GNOME Photos, iconographer, …)

With GEGL you chain together processing operations to represent the
desired image processing pipeline. GEGL provides operations for image
loading and storing, color adjustments, GIMPs artistic filters and more
forms of image processing GEGL can be used on the command-line with the
same syntax that can be used for creating processing flows
interactively with text from GIMP using gegl-graph.

The primary repository for the GEGL source code is in the GNOME git
repository. Release tarballs may be downloaded from the GIMP download
site and a a summary of changes is available in the release notes.

GEGL is Free Software, and both new functionality in new operations as
well as relevant development, enhancement requests, patches and bug
reports for GEGL at gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/gegl

Financial support, to allow us to create fun new filters and
capabilities as well as to perform general maintenance activities, is
welcome through the patreon campaign at GIMPs donation page.
